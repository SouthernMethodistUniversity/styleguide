# Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting

Most formatting guidelines here are designed to make markdown source files more readable. Others are designed to preserve semantics, which allow markdown to be rendered the same in different contexts.

# Formatting .md files 
* Formatting should be as follows:  
  * Separate paragraphs with a blank line.  
  * Place blank lines between elements whenever possible. For example, put a blank line between a heading and a paragraph, and between a paragraph and an image link.  
  * Use headings consistently, and use them only to denote new sections. For example, do not use headings for emphasis.  
  * Use other markdown elements for their intended purpose. Use lists for lists and emphasis for emphasis. For example, do not use emphasis in place of a heading.  
  * Unless a raw URL is part of the tutorial, don't leave raw URLs in your document. Incorporate the link into the flow of your prose.  
  * If code segments are short, indicate them by indenting. If they're longer, use the ````` syntax.  
  * When introducing new commands or code, put them on a new line so they stand out from the rest of the text.  
  * When including images, don't leave the alt text segment [] blank. Fill it in with information that would be useful if the image could not be seen or rendered.  
  * Is coding consistent throughout module?  
  * First header is H1, secondary headers H2, etc. (H1 only used at top of page, H2 used to break sections into chunks, H3 only used if necessary within sections that already have an H2.   
  * Compare to outline format:  
  H1 (title of page)  
  H2 (first section)  
  H3 (point 1)  
  H3 (point 2)  
  H3 (point 3)  
  H2 (second section) with no H3 titles necessary  
  H2 (third section)  
  * Are there any extraneous Markdown tags due to errors in coding? (hashtags, dashes, etc.)  
  *If many topics or headings are included in the tutorial (more than 6), the markdown files other than the README.md should be placed in a folder within the repository labelled sections or similar and linked from there. (Having too many files in the files section on GitHub looks messy and is visually overwhelming.)  
  * While you have the option to create tutorials under your own name on GitHub, when finished or when you reach a major milestone with your tutorial, fork it to the DHRI account on GitHub for reference by future instructors.  
  * Do we want to include the contribution information in the style guide?  
  * Hyperlinks:   
  * Do all modules have working Previous/Next links at the top and bottom of each page?  
  * Have all links embedded in the module been tested and updated if necessary, or removed if necessary?
