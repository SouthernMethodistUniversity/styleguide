# Content

## ReadMe
The Readme for each workshop should contain the following:
# An H1 level heading with the name of the tutorial
### Contact information 
Who is teaching this workshop? 
What SMU unit are they in?
What is their contact information?
### Learning Prerequisites 
What prerequisites are required to get the most of out of this workshop? 
What are participants already expected to know?
### Technology Prerequisites
What are the technology requirements for the workshop? 
Is it online? 
Will they need to install any software on their laptop? 
Do they need to make sure they have administrative permissions for this laptop?
### Learning Objectives
What will they learn in this workshop? 
### Description: 
A short paragraph with an accessible description of the technique
Table of contents with links to the topics in the tutorial

### Modules  
Introduction: Describes the technique or technology in more detail, ideally also explaining the purpose or value of the approach
Pages: Each major concept or milestone in the tutorial should have a new page.
Code segments should be denoted using the markdown syntax for code and interspersed with explanations. Large blocks of unexplained code should be avoided, but if they're necessary link to a raw text file or Jupyter notebook within the explanatory text.

## Attribution
### Free and Open Source Code

In general, it's not necessary to provide in-line citations in the materials for a technical workshop unless you're using someone else's exact prose or you're replicating a significant, non-trivial section of code. For example, code segments found on Stack Overflow do not need to be cited unless you think it's pedagogically helpful. However, if you build your session around replicating a significant portion of a particular application, you must consider the license under which that software is released and consider providing attribution, even if attribution is not required under the terms of the license. In general, free and open source code licenses do not require attribution, but using a large portion of the code may require replicating the license. Check a summary of the terms of the license (or the license itself, if you're feeling adventurous) if you decide to replicate a significant portion of an open-source project in your session.

### Citation practices for workshops

Many of the workshops in this curriculum were created by multiple creators. This makes the process of attributing of each other a bit messy. An interested person can see the precise details what was done and by whom in what order in the GitHub commit log. However, we also realize that folks reading this curriculum may not be Git-literate (yet!) or may access this curriculum as a .PDF or a hard copy document offline. Thus, it is also important to attribute the labor of individual contributors in written form at the beginning of each workshop and every other section of this curriculum. 

Currently, the workshops include two forms of attribution: "Session leader: ..." and "Based on previous work by ..."â€”the former indicates the person who will be the lead teacher of the workshop during the Summer 2020 DHRI session, and the latter indicates who worked on the content of the workshop. We recognize that both are significant attributions, but that the latter is especially important in terms of citation politics, particularly for students and junior scholars. So, despite its redundancy, we listed a contributors name twice if they both are leading the workshop in June 2018 and if they created or significantly contributed to or revised the workshop's content. It is also of note that various contributors edited the content of each others' workshops.  

In regards to citing other academics, this curriculum aims to follow commonly held academic citation practices, in which direct quotations are formatted and cited as such, and when another scholar's ideas or concepts are referenced, a citation is also included. In general, the following citation information is provided: the author name(s), publication title, and publication date, and a hyperlink to the source, if applicable and within copyright.  

Are all sections used through open source code properly cited and linked to?
Are all hyperlinks cited?
APA style (or a different style? minimum title & link)
