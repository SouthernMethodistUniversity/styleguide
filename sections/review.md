# Review
As our goal is that our lessons build on each on each other. We will review lessons for content and where they fit in to other workshops. 

## Process of Review 
Creation of these workshops is collaborative and review is an iterative process. 
We will review for: *Pedagogy, Content and grammar.*  

### Grammar
Check all spelling and punctuation throughout. 
All bulleted lists should end in some type of end mark (period, question mark, etc.).
Read through all content to make sure sections or content is not duplicated or repetitive, or that there are not disruptive jumps from one topic to another without explanation.
